# Introduction

Bevy shader playground is a playground to explore and mess with shaders using [Bevy]. I recently found myself facinated by
shaders and wanted to learn more about them. I started with the great [Learn Wgpu] tutorial and then found a really neat
tutorial by [hakolao](https://github.com/hakolao) which explores compute shaders with [Bevy]
using [Vulkano]. If you are interested, this is the tutorial [compute_shader_tutorial].

Jump right into the [Bevy Game of Life Shader] tutorial.
